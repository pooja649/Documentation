Once we created the fee of teh student for a single month now we have a problem is that we have to repeat the task again for every month so we need to automate this process in order to provide the clean and efficient approach.So we automate this process with auto-repeat tool and makes evry student fee on repeat once it created. It will automatically created after every month and we set the due date 15 days ahed of the date of creation of the fee so the status of the fee will be changes to overdue after due date.
